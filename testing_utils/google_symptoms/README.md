# Validation for Google Symptoms
This directory is used for one-time validations that would be too expensive 
or wouldn't make sense to be in tests. 

## Validate_patch
### Background
The previous back-filling behavior did not consider issue dates and would write all the previously missing data into one date.
This script is used validation for correctness for the new patching code. 
We want to ensure that the output generated by the patching script would be what we would expect.


This script checks for 3 things:
- number of days per issue date
- comparing patch run vs a regular run set at the same date
- comparison between the patch run and what's in the api

###  Instructions to Run
prerequsite -- need to run google-symptom indicator locally check README in the google_symptoms directory and the patch.py in delphi_google_symptoms
- Run patch module in delphi_google_symptoms (optionally also a regular run) 
- move the output to this directory
- set virtual environment

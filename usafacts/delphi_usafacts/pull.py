def pull_usafacts_data(base_url: str, metric: str, geo_mapper: GeoMapper) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Pull the latest USA Facts data, and conform it into a dataset.

    The output dataset has:

    - Each row corresponds to (County, Date), denoted (FIPS, timestamp)
    - Each row additionally has a column `new_counts` corresponding to the new
      new_counts (either `confirmed` cases or `deaths`), and a column
      `cumulative_counts`, correspond to the aggregate metric from January 22nd
      (as of April 27th) until the latest date.

    Note that the raw dataset gives the `cumulative_counts` metric, from which
    we compute `new_counts` by taking first differences.  Hence, `new_counts`
    may be negative.  This is wholly dependent on the quality of the raw
    dataset.

    We filter the data such that we only keep rows with valid FIPS, or "FIPS"
    codes defined under the exceptions of the README.  The current  exceptions
    include:

    # - 6000: Grand Princess Cruise Ship
    # - 2270: Wade Hampton Census Area in AK, but no cases/deaths were assigned
    # - 0: statewise unallocated
    # - 1: New York City Unallocated/Probable (only exists for NYC)

    PS:  No information for PR
    Parameters
    ----------
    base_url: str
        Base URL for pulling the USA Facts data
    metric: str
        One of 'confirmed' or 'deaths'. The keys of base_url.
    geo_mapper: GeoMapper
        GeoMapper object with population info.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        Dataframe as described above.

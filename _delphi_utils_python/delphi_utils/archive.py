"""
Utilities for diffing and archiving covidcast export CSVs.

Aims to simplify the creation of issues for new and backfilled value for indicators.
Also handles archiving of export CSVs to some backend (git, S3 etc.) before replacing them.

Example workflow regardless of specific ArchiveDiffer used. Should only differ in intialization.
1) Initialize and update cache folder if neccessary
>>> arch_diff = S3ArchiveDiffer(cache_dir, export_dir, ...)
>>> arch_diff.update_cache()
>>> ... # Run indicator and generate full exports in `export_dir`

2) Create new diff files from cache files vs export files
>>> deleted_files, common_diffs, new_files = arch_diff.diff_exports()

3) Archive common files with diffs and new files
>>> to_archive = [f for f, diff in common_diffs.items() if diff is not None]
>>> to_archive += new_files
>>> succs, fails = arch_diff.archive_exports(to_archive)

4) Filter exports: Replace files with their diffs, or remove if no diffs
>>> succ_common_diffs = {f: diff for f, diff in common_diffs.items() if f not in fails}
>>> arch_diff.filter_exports(succ_common_diffs)

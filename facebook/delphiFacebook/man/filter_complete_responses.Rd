* answered age consent
* CID/token IS NOT missing
* distribution source (ie previews) IS NOT irregular
* start date IS IN range, pacific time
* Date is in [`params$start_date - params$backfill_days`, `end_date`],
inclusive.
* answered minimum of 2 additional questions, where to "answer" a numeric
open-ended question (A2, A2b, B2b, Q40, C10_1_1, C10_2_1, C10_3_1, C10_4_1,
D3, D4, D5) means to provide any number (floats okay) and to "answer" a radio

Most of these criteria are handled by `filter_responses()` above; this
function need only handle the last criterion.

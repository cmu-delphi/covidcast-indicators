Even if you are healthy, your responses may contribute to a better public health understanding of where the coronavirus pandemic is moving, to improve our local and national responses.
The data captured does not include any personally identifiable information about you and your answers to all questions will remain confidential. Published results will be in aggregate and will not identify individual participants or their responses.  This study is not conducted by Facebook and no individual responses will be shared back to Facebook.  The only information we receive from Facebook is a random ID number and a statistical number that help us weigh participation properly.

# USA Facts Cases and Deaths

We import the confirmed case and deaths data from USA Facts website and export
the county-level data as-is.  We also aggregate the data to the MSA, HRR, and
State levels.

In order to avoid confusing public consumers of the data, we maintain
consistency how USA Facts reports the data, please refer to [Exceptions](#Exceptions).

## Geographical Levels (`geo`)
* `county`: reported using zero-padded FIPS codes.  There are some exceptions
  that lead to inconsistency with the other COVIDcast data (but are necessary
  for internal consistency), noted below.  
* `msa`: reported using cbsa (consistent with all other COVIDcast sensors)
* `hrr`: reported using HRR number (consistent with all other COVIDcast sensors)
* `state`: reported using two-letter postal code

## Metrics, Level 1 (`m1`)
* `confirmed`: Confirmed cases
* `deaths`

Recoveries are _not_ reported.

## Metrics, Level 2 (`m2`)
* `new_counts`: number of new {confirmed cases, deaths} on a given day
* `cumulative_counts`: total number of {confirmed cases, deaths} up until the
  first day of data (January 22nd)
* `incidence`: `new_counts` / population * 100000

All three `m2` are ultimately derived from `cumulative_counts`, which is first
available on January 22nd.  In constructing `new_counts`, we take the first
discrete difference of `cumulative_counts`,  and assume that the
`cumulative_counts` for January 21st is uniformly zero.  This should not be a
problem, because there there is only one county with a nonzero
`cumulative_count` on January 22nd, with a value of 1.

For deriving `incidence`, we use the estimated 2019 county population values
from the US Census Bureau.  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html

## Exceptions

At the County (FIPS) level, we report the data _exactly_ as USA Facts reports their
data, to prevent confusing public consumers of the data.
The visualization and modeling teams should take note of these exceptions.

### New York City

New York City comprises of five boroughs:

|Borough Name       |County Name        |FIPS Code      |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
|Manhattan          |New York County    |36061          |
|The Bronx          |Bronx County       |36005          |
|Brooklyn           |Kings County       |36047          |
|Queens             |Queens County      |36081          |
|Staten Island      |Richmond County    |36085          |

**New York City Unallocated cases/deaths are reported by USA Facts independently.** We split them evenly among the five NYC FIPS, which results in float numbers. 

All NYC counts are mapped to the MSA with CBSA ID 35620, which encompasses
all five boroughs.  All NYC counts are mapped to HRR 303, which intersects
all five boroughs (297 also intersects the Bronx, 301 also intersects
Brooklyn and Queens, but absent additional information, We are leaving all
counts in 303).


### Mismatched FIPS Codes

There are two FIPS codes that were changed in 2015, leading to
mismatch between us and USA Facts.  We report the data using the FIPS code used
by USA Facts, again to promote consistency and avoid confusion by external users
of the dataset.  For the mapping to MSA, HRR, these two counties are
included properly.

|County Name        |State          |"Our" FIPS         |USA Facts FIPS       |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
|Oglala Lakota      |South Dakota   |46113              |46102          |
|Kusilvak           |Alaska         |02270              |02158 \& 02270         |

Documentation for the changes made by the US Census Bureau in 2015:
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html

Besides, Wade Hampton Census Area and Kusilvak Census Area are reported by USA Facts with FIPS 02270 and 02158 respectively, though there is always 0 cases/deaths reported for Wade Hampton Census Area (02270). According to US Census Bureau, Wade Hampton Census Area has changed name and code from Wade Hampton Census Area, Alaska (02270) to Kusilvak Census Area, Alaska (02158) effective July 1, 2015.

### Grand Princess Cruise Ship
Data from Grand Princess Cruise Ship is given its own dedicated line, with FIPS code 6000. We just ignore these cases/deaths. 




## Negative incidence

Negative incidence is possible because figures are sometimes revised
downwards, e.g., when a public health authority moves cases from County X
to County Y, County X may have negative incidence.

## Non-integral counts

Because the MSA and HRR numbers are computed by taking population-weighted
averages, the count data at those geographical levels may be non-integral.

## Counties not in our canonical dataset

Some FIPS codes do not appear as the primary FIPS for any ZIP code in our
canonical `02_20_uszips.csv`; they appear in the `county` exported files, but
for the MSA/HRR mapping, we disburse them equally to the counties with whom
they appear as a secondary FIPS code.  The identification of such "secondary"
FIPS codes are documented in `notebooks/create-mappings.ipynb`.  The full list
of `secondary, [mapped]` is:

```
SECONDARY_FIPS = [   # generated by notebooks/create-mappings.ipynb
	('51620', ['51093', '51175']),
	('51685', ['51153']),
	('28039', ['28059', '28041', '28131', '28045', '28059', '28109',
                    '28047']),
	('51690', ['51089', '51067']),
	('51595', ['51081', '51025', '51175', '51183']),
	('51600', ['51059', '51059', '51059']),
	('51580', ['51005']),
	('51678', ['51163']),
    ]
```

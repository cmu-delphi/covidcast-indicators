"""
This file contains the smoothing utility functions. We have a number of
possible smoothers to choose from: windowed average, local weighted regression,
and a causal Savitzky-Golay filter.

Code is courtesy of Dmitry Shemetov, Maria Jahja, and Addison Hu.

These smoothers are all functions that take a 1D numpy array and return a smoothed
1D numpy array of the same length (with a few np.nans in the beginning). See the
docstrings for details.

class Smoother:
    """
    This is the smoothing utility class. This class holds the parameter settings for its smoother
    methods and provides reasonable defaults. Basic usage can be found in the examples below.

    The smoother function takes numpy arrays or pandas Series as input, expecting the values to be
    on a regularly-spaced time grid. NANs are ok, as long as the array does not begin with a NAN.
    The rest of the NANs will be handled via imputation by default, though this can be turned off.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smoother_name: {'savgol', 'moving_average', 'identity', 'left_gauss_linear'}
        This variable specifies the smoother. We have four smoothers, currently:
        * 'savgol' or a Savtizky-Golay smoother (default)
        * 'moving_average' or a moving window average smoother
        * 'identity' or the trivial smoother (no smoothing)
        * 'left_gauss_linear' or a Gaussian-weight linear regression smoother
        Descriptions of the smoothers are available in the doc strings. Full mathematical
        details are in: https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covidcast-modeling/ in the folder
        'indicator_smoother'.
    window_length: int
        The length of the averaging window for 'savgol' and 'moving_average'.
        This value is in the units of the data, which tends to be days.
    gaussian_bandwidth: float or None
        If float, all regression is done with Gaussian weights whose variance is
        half the gaussian_bandwidth. If None, performs unweighted regression. (Applies
        to 'left_gauss_linear' and 'savgol'.)
        Here are some reference values (the given bandwidth produces a 95% weighting on
        the data of length time window into the past):
        time window    |     bandwidth
        7                        36
        14                       144
        21                       325
        28                       579
        35                       905
        42                       1303
    impute: {'savgol', 'zeros', None}
        If 'savgol' (default), will fill nan values with a savgol fit on the largest available time
        window prior (up to window_length). If 'zeros', will fill nan values with zeros.
        If None, leaves the nans in place.
    minval: float or None
        The smallest value to allow in a signal. If None, there is no smallest value.
        Currently only implemented for 'left_gauss_linear'. This should probably not be in the scope
        of the smoothing utility.
    poly_fit_degree: int
        A parameter for the 'savgol' smoother which sets the degree of the polynomial fit.

    Methods
    ----------
    smooth: np.ndarray or pd.Series
        Takes a 1D signal and returns a smoothed version. The input and the output have the same length
        and type.

    Example Usage
    -------------
    Example 1. Apply a rolling average smoother with a window of length 10.
    >>> smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='moving_average', window_length=10)
    >>> smoothed_signal = smoother.smooth(signal)

    Example 2. Smooth a dataframe column.
    >>> smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='savgol')
    >>> df[col] = df[col].transform(smoother.smooth)

    Example 3. Apply a rolling weighted average smoother, with 95% weight on the recent 2 weeks and
               a sharp cutoff after 4 weeks.
    >>> smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='savgol', poly_fit_degree=0, window_length=28,
                          gaussian_bandwidth=144)
    >>> smoothed_signal = smoother.smooth(signal)

    Example 4. Apply a local linear regression smoother (essentially equivalent to
               `left_gauss_linear`), with 95% weight on the recent week and a sharp
               cutoff after 3 weeks.
    >>> smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='savgol', poly_fit_degree=1, window_length=21,
                          gaussian_bandwidth=36)
    >>> smoothed_signal = smoother.smooth(signal)

    Example 5. Apply the identity function (simplifies code that iterates through smoothers _and_
               expects a copy of the raw data).
    >>> smoother = Smoother(smoother_name='identity')
    >>> smoothed_signal = smoother.smooth(signal)

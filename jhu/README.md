# Johns Hopkins University Cases and Deaths

We import the confirmed case and deaths data from Johns Hopkins CSSE and export
the county-level data as-is.  We also aggregate the data to the MSA, HRR, HHS, 
State, and Nation levels. For detailed information see the files `DETAILS.md` contained
in this directory.

## Running the Indicator

The indicator is run by directly executing the Python module contained in this
directory. The safest way to do this is to create a virtual environment,
installed the common DELPHI tools, and then install the module and its
dependencies. To do this, run the following code from this directory:

```
make install
```

This command will install the package in editable mode, so you can make changes that
will automatically propagate to the installed package. 

All of the user-changable parameters are stored in `params.json`. To execute
the module and produce the output datasets (by default, in `receiving`), run
the following:

```
env/bin/python -m delphi_jhu
```

If you want to enter the virtual environment in your shell, 
you can run `source env/bin/activate`. Run `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment. 

Once you are finished, you can remove the virtual environment and 
params file with the following:

```
make clean
```

## Testing the code

To run static tests of the code style, run the following command:

```
make lint
```

Unit tests are also included in the module. To execute these, run the following
command from this directory:

```
make test
```

To run individual tests, run the following:

```
(cd tests && ../env/bin/pytest <your_test>.py --cov=delphi_jhu --cov-report=term-missing)
```

The output will show the number of unit tests that passed and failed, along
with the percentage of code covered by the tests. 

None of the linting or unit tests should fail, and the code lines that are not covered by unit tests should be small and
should not include critical sub-routines.

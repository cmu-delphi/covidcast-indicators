# Covidcast Indicators

[![License: MIT][mit-image]][mit-url]

In early April 2020, Delphi developed a uniform data schema 
for [a new Epidata endpoint focused on COVID-19](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html). 
Our intent was to provide signals from which the course 
of the COVID-19 pandemic might be predicted 
using statistical models and forecasters. 
Delphi's long history in forecasting influenza 
made us uniquely situated to provide access 
to data streams not available anywhere else, 
including medical claims data, electronic medical records, 
lab test records, massive public surveys, and internet search trends. 
We also process popular publicly available data sources, 
both for convenience and to provide data versioning 
for sources that do not track revisions themselves.

Each data stream arrives in a different format 
using a different delivery technique, be it sftp, 
an access-controlled API, or an email attachment. 
The purpose of each pipeline in this repository 
is to fetch the raw source data, 
extract aggregate signals useful for forecasting, 
and output those signals in a common format 
for upload to the [COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html).

A subset of the resulting **Real-time COVID-19 Indicators** 
are visualized in the Delphi Group's [**COVIDcast** map](https://covidcast.cmu.edu).

## Organization

Utilities:
* `_delphi_utils_python` - common behaviors
* `_template_python` & `_template_r` - starting points for new data sources
* `ansible` & `jenkins` - automated testing and deployment
* `sir_complainsalot` - a Slack bot to check for missing data

Indicator pipelines: all remaining directories.

Each indicator pipeline includes its own documentation. 

* Consult README.md for directions to install, lint, test, and run the pipeline for that indicator. 
* Consult REVIEW.md for the checklist to use for code reviews. 
* Consult DETAILS.md (if present) for implementation details, including handling of corner cases.

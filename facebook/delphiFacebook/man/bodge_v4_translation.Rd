\title{Fix translation error in Wave 6.}
\usage{
bodge_v4_translation(input_data, wave)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{data frame of responses, before subsetting to select
variables}

\item{wave}{integer indicating survey version}
}
\value{
corrected data frame, where V4 is the authoritative column
}
\description{
In Wave 6's first deployment, some of the translations swapped the order of
responses in V4, so these responses can't be interpreted correctly. Rather
than recoding them, we simply delete non-English translations of V4.
}
\details{
The updated deployment replaces V4 with V4a with correct translations. We
delete non-English V4 responses, then use V4a in place of V4 when present.

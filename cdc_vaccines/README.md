# CDC Vaccinations

This indicator provides the number official vaccinations in the US. We export the county-level 
daily vaccination rates data as-is, and publishes the result as a COVIDcast signal. 
We also aggregate the data to the MSA, HRR, State, HHS Region, and Nation levels. 
For detailed information see the files DETAILS.md contained in this directory.

Note that individuals could be vaccinated outside of the US. Additionally, 
there is no county level data for counties in Texas and Hawaii. There are unknown 
counties in each state and a row for unknown county and unknown state.


## Running the Indicator

The indicator is run by directly executing the Python module contained in this
directory. The safest way to do this is to create a virtual environment,
installed the common DELPHI tools, and then install the module and its
dependencies. To do this, run the following command from this directory:

```
make install
```

This command will install the package in editable mode, so you can make changes that
will automatically propagate to the installed package. 

All of the user-changable parameters are stored in `params.json`. To execute
the module and produce the output datasets (by default, in `receiving`), run
the following:

```
env/bin/python -m delphi_cdc_vaccines
```

If you want to enter the virtual environment in your shell, 
you can run `source env/bin/activate`. Run `deactivate` to leave the virtual environment. 

Once you are finished, you can remove the virtual environment and 
params file with the following:

```
make clean
```

## Testing the code

To run static tests of the code style, run the following command:

```
make lint
```

Unit tests are also included in the module. To execute these, run the following
command from this directory:

```
make test
```

To run individual tests, run the following:

```
(cd tests && ../env/bin/pytest test_run.py --cov=delphi_ --cov-report=term-missing)
```

The output will show the number of unit tests that passed and failed, along
with the percentage of code covered by the tests. 

None of the linting or unit tests should fail, and the code lines that are not covered by unit tests should be small and
should not include critical sub-routines.
